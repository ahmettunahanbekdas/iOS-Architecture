# iOS Software Architecture

This project adopts a modular architectural approach to optimize iOS application development processes, allowing components to be designed and managed independently. The application utilizes a Presenter layer and Dependency Injection (DI) to create a flexible and testable structure. Additionally, a Network framework has been developed to handle service operations, using the Alamofire library for managing network requests.

## Architecture

### Modular Architecture

Modular architecture structures the application components as independent modules, facilitating maintenance and scalability. This structure allows each module to take on its own responsibilities, providing better organization and testability.

## Presenter Layer and Dependency Injection

The Presenter layer manages the interaction between the Model and View, separating business logic from UI components. This separation simplifies application maintenance. Dependency Injection enables the management of dependencies between components from an external source.

#### Advantages:
- **Flexibility:** Providing dependencies from external sources increases the reusability of components.
- **Testability:** Writing unit tests becomes easier with mock objects.

## Network Framework and Alamofire Usage

The developed Network framework is used to manage HTTP requests for interaction with APIs. Alamofire is preferred for simplifying and effectively executing network requests. With Alamofire, asynchronous operations are managed, and error handling and data serialization processes are centralized.

#### Advantages:
- **Simplicity:** Alamofire simplifies complex network requests and improves code readability.
- **Error Management:** Centralized handling of response processing and error scenarios enhances application resilience.

## MVVM and MVC Applications

The project contains two separate versions that provide similar functionality using MVVM and MVC architectures.

#### MVC Approach

In Apple's MVC architecture, View and Controller components are typically used together. However, in this project, the View and Controller components are designed separately, providing better modularity and testability to the application. This separation simplifies the management and updating of UI components.

## Binding Operations with Protocols

Protocols provide a strong layer of abstraction in Swift, allowing for the management of communication between components. When binding operations are performed through protocols, low coupling between components is achieved, enhancing flexibility.

#### Advantages:
- **Independence:** Components interact with each other through protocols.
- **Reusability:** Protocols facilitate the easy integration of different components.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests have been written in this project to verify that each component functions correctly. Unit tests enhance the reliability of the application and assist in early detection of errors.

#### Why Unit Tests?
- **Error Detection:** Errors are identified in the early stages of development, preventing larger issues.
- **Code Quality:** Writing tests contributes to cleaner, more readable, and maintainable code.
